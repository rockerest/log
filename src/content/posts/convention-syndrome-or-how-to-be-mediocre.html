        Not too long ago, I interviewed a potential candidate for a front end developer position.
        As part of the interview, I asked the interviewee if they had ever used OAuth2 in coordination
        with their JavaScript application. They had, and I asked them to show it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        The candidate explained to me how they had used <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> to install
        the <a href="https://github.com/meanjs/generator-meanjs">mean.js generator</a>. Then the interviewee
        showed me some code not really related to OAuth. As I watched them, I pointed out some places the OAuth
        handling might be done, but we dropped it before we found anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last thing the candidate said regarding OAuth was <em>&quot;I used Yeoman to generate the MEAN
        application and one of the options was to set up authentication, so I said yes and it just set
        it up for me. I know it uses <a href="http://passportjs.org/">Passport</a>.&quot;</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, Passport has very little to do with your application
        <a href="http://oauth.net/articles/authentication/">performing an authentication handshake</a> with
        an authentication service &mdash; except that Passport <strong>is</strong> the authentication service. The
        front end must handle access tokens, OAuth claims, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, I asked the same candidate to
        <a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">write
        the FizzBuzz program</a>. Besides taking way too long, the interviewee couldn't remember the syntax
        for a <span class="fw">for</span> loop, and resorted to writing a function that simulated a
        <span class="fw">for</span> loop using a <span class="fw">while</span> loop. They explained this
        oversight was because they typically used library iterators like
        <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#each">Underscore's <span class="fw">.each</span></a>.
    </p>

        The one thing that sticks out &mdash; and is reaffirmed over and over &mdash; is that an affliction is spreading (has spread?)
        among some developers. I've called it <em>Convention Syndrome</em>, but it could easily be
        called <em>Generator Syndrome</em>.

    <h3>What's Going On?</h3>
    <p>
        More and more, the tools that we use are billed as <em>&quot;the last [X] you'll ever need.&quot;</em> Having
        things done for you is more desirable than knowing how it works. <em>&quot;Spin up a prototype in 15
        minutes,&quot;</em> or any variation of the amount of time, is so common that it makes me cringe just
        hearing it. The problem I have seen over and over is that &mdash; despite being able to present a prototype
        in a short amount of time &mdash; the developer is rarely able to create a truly innovative end result.
        A convention can only hold your hand so far, and a generator will never meet exactly your business' needs.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        If I choose a tool to do each job, I have to know how they all hook together.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I have used <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for a long time, and recently switched to
        <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. One of the many things these editors have in common is that they are simple.
        In fact, I'm writing this post in Atom right now. The beauty of a tool that does a basic task like <em>edit text</em>
        and really nothing more has many facets, but here are two:
        <ul>
            <li>
                It can do it well.
            </li>
            <li>
                It forces me to understand the interactions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I generally choose a tool for each job, and each tool runs independently of the others. If I choose a tool to do
        each job, I have to know how they all hook together. That is a positive thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The important distinction here is that &quot;job&quot; is absolutely not &quot;get a web app working.&quot; A task
        is something much more concrete, like &quot;manage routing, hashchange, and URL history on the client side.&quot;
        By the way, that's a task I'd earmark for <a href="http://sammyjs.org/">Sammy.js</a> to handle, but I'll talk
        about that another time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's go back to my interviewee from before. As we looked through OAuth2 code, I saw something familiar:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + Cookie( "access" )
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        This is the code to add the Authorization header to a request, and provide your stored OAuth Bearer Token to the
        API. Sure that we had just stumbled upon the OAuth handler code implementation, I asked the candidate
        <em>&quot;where in your application is that access cookie set?&quot;</em> This is an application that this person
        <strong>built</strong>, and their answer was, <em>&quot;...Uh, I'm not really sure.&quot;</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Reliance on generators and convention to &quot;make our jobs easier&quot; is doing nothing but creating a breed
        of developer who's no better than the documentation of their tool <em>du jour</em>. The ability to think
        &quot;outside-the-box&quot; apparently only applies if the newest tool on the block has a bigger box than
        the tool that was being used previously. Knowledge of application architecture and understanding how systems work
        seem to be scoped to only the tool. As soon as the tool disappears, stops being maintained, stops meeting needs,
        or &mdash; frankly &mdash; stops being &quot;cool&quot; (whatever that means), so too does that knowledge
        disappear, never applied again.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why I'm calling this <em>Convention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome">Syndrome</a></em>: not
        because conventions are the problem, but because it seems that the trend has been to forgo <em>understanding</em>
        for the sake of <em>convention</em>. These symptoms may all stem from a central issue, perhaps a level of laziness,
        perhaps a desire to produce instead of understand. Whatever the reason, I'm diagnosing the syndrome, not the condition.
        The real issue is that the <em>Convention Syndrome</em> is creating a plethora of developers who appear to be wildly
        unskilled if you move them just inches outside their comfort zone.

    <h3>The Web, A La Carte</h3>
    <p>
        One of the problems I haven't even touched on regarding this topic is future-proofing applications. The reason I
        haven't touched on it is because I can rant at length about it, but more importantly: because it's not central to
        the symptoms of the syndrome.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, however, it would behoove me to mention one piece of maintainability to help explain why <em>a la
        carte</em> is so powerful. Let's assume you've chosen a monolith to build your app. Let's call it <em>Angelic</em>.
        It does everything for you except butter your bread. It comes with some tradeoffs, like you hard code the names
        of your models directly into the presentation template, and you do the same thing with code to respond to events
        like clicks &mdash; they're written right into the HTML. You know this isn't great, but it's the
        <em>Angelic</em> way, and you get so much from the framework. Then, one day a long time from now, <em>Angelic</em>
        is no longer being maintained, and you need a feature in your models that it doesn't provide. Instead of swapping
        out the tool that provides your models, you're stuck <strong>rewriting your app from scratch, because...
        monolith.</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Are you a programmer? An integrator? Or can you actually create?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Of course, the alternative is to choose the right tool for each job. Understanding how each piece of your code works
        with each other piece fosters not only responsible development (and develop<em>ers</em>), but it encourages
        experimentation and progressive thinking. If you understand what's going on under the hood, you're able to envision
        solutions that would have been completely obscured to you when something else was handling all of the grunt work.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the question becomes: Are you a programmer? An integrator? Or can you actually create? It doesn't need to be
        from scratch, but you should at least know which parts you need to make it all work.
    </p>
